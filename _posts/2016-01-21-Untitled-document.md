In class we discussed about different media examples and how they are fantasy or not. We looked at how Mcdonald's make their normal cheese burgers differently from the one's you see on TV. They use the exact same ingredients as they do in the fast food cafe but take hours making it perfect. They make it so that all the ingredients are seen in the photo and the meat done to perfection, they syringe the tomato ketchup into the bun and melt the cheese just right. They even have their own food artist!! We watched a short pepsi advertisement about a monkey driving a taxi and looked at the fantasy part of it (a monkey driving a taxi) and the non-fantasy part of it (that the pepsi has no sugar).
