We learnt about fantasy and non-fantasy and how they are used in advertisement. For example we looked at how Mcdonald's make their normal cheese burgers differently from the one's you see on TV. They use the exact same ingredients as they do in the fast food cafe but take hours making it perfect. They make it so that all the ingredients are seen in the photo and the meat done to perfection, they syringe the tomato ketchup into the bun and melt the cheese just right. They even have their own food artist!! There was a short pepsi advertisement about a monkey driving a taxi and we discussed the fantasy part of it (a monkey driving a taxi) and the non-fantasy part of it (that the pepsi has no sugar, but instead has other more harmful contents).

We have been taught about the text (what you can see in the advert) and subtext (the hidden message) in commercials and adverts and also the untold story within it.

We finished with a lesson about your identity and how we show our identity on social media compared to our actual life. For example if you picked your nose you would not put that in your social media and put something good like you have a passion for sport.
