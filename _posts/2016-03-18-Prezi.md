In class we learnt how to use prezi which is a website where you can create presentations. We made our own accounts which we then used to create simple prezis using templates from the wide variety of choice. We learnt how to insert images and arrows into our presentations and change the path in which the presentation goes. The great thing about using prezi is that it looks very cool and uses zooming in and out as a way to create a better presentation.
