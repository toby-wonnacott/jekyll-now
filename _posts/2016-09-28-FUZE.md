In lesson we learnt how to setup and use the FUZE box. We went through a manual that was given to us and coded stuff onto it. First of all we went through the basics of coding like making the FUZE say " hello world â€œ in the colours of our choices. This activity is done in pairs of your choice which will be sticking to for the rest of this project. I am with Ethan.
