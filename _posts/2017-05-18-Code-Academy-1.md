    <td>I learnt from reading the information box on the right hand side of the screen and then doing the task that was set. The strategy I found effective was making sure I do read the information box carefully and not just trying to quickly finish it by doing the task. If I did not read the information box then I found out later on I did not know how things worked and what they were used for.</td>

    <td>I will make sure I read the whole information provided so that I learn more and will be able to put python to good use. This will improve my learning as I will understand more of the topic and find it less difficult when it comes to harder tasks.</td>
