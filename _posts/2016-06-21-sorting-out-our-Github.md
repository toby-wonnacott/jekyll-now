In today's lesson we were fixing our GitHub pages by deleting the repository and then creating it again by forking it from Barry Clarks GitHub post. We learnt how to prevent our GitHub from breaking and how to fix it. Many people had all kind of problems with their GitHub and if I were to do better at fixing my GitHub I would have better knowledge of how to fix it and how to know what to do. I think I did well choosing the right colour scheme using style.sccs.
