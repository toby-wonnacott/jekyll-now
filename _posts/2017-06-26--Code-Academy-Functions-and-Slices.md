    <td>I learnt how to use slices in code which makes things alot easier when adding numbers and putting them in lists. The strategies i found effective were reading from the instructions and learning from the hints and examples.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes I did not understand what I had to do from reading the instructions so I had to adapt and and eventually work out and change my code.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is reading the instructions and carefully r3eading it which will help improve my speed at getting through the work. I will improve my learning by making sure I actually reading the examples and understanding what it means and what I am doing with the code.</td>
