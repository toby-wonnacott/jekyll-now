    <td>In this lesson me and my partner created a code that said "I Love Aliens" with the picture of the space invader. We made this in different coloured letters and background. We worked from the FUZE booklet making sure we read the extra bits this time.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was not getting distracted from all of the cool stuff that me and my partner made but carrying on with the work we had. This limited my learning as we could've used that time to carry on working through the exercises. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is spending less time actually playing with our final code rather than working through the rest of the work. This will mean that we will have completed more of the code set out for us in the manual. Spending less time paying around will improve my learning because it will have meant that we learnt more in a lesson than we would have.</td>
