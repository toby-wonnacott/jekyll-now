We described in threes when we felt connected with somebody via social media and on google docs we wrote positive guidelines on how to use it and not how to use it.

We then watched two videos. The first one was about a girl and everywhere she went there were people on their iphones. For example: she was holding a birthday cake for someone and was waiting for him to blow them out whilst everyone else was on their phone's, also in the video the girl walked past a man proposing to his girlfriend and whilst they kissed he was taking a selfie. This underlines how much we are glued to our phones all the time and without one you're lonely and bored.

The next video was a music video on twitter and a girl who thinks it's rubbish at the beginning but because all of the people have it and are telling her how good it is. The video however makes fun of twitter and how everyone posts stupid things such as pictures of their shoes.
