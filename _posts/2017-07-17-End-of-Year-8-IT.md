End of Year 8 IT

This year in IT I have enjoyed coding  the robot arm the most as it was really fun. Me and my partner got to control the arm in whatever way we wanted and we made it do really cool stuff such as picking up pencils and making it drop it into your hand. Overall IT was very enjoyable and codecademy was a fun way to learn code. However, codecademy took much longer as you got further on in the stages unlike the fuze boxes which did not. In my opinion I learnt much more from codecademy than all our other topics and taking the time to complete each exercise payed off.
