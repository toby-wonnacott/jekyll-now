Over the weeks we have learnt a lot about media and different ways you can use it. We learnt about the advantages and disadvantages of social media and how it may affect us. The main advantages were things like you can keep in contact with your friends and family or you can keep up to date with the news. The main disadvantages were things like there can be upsetting or nasty comments pointed towards you or being hacked by someone and them putting stuff up that you don't want to put up. 

We have discussed about something said in class saying that you can be stalked and people can find where abouts you live, but you can only be stalked if you are willing to put the information up on social media.
