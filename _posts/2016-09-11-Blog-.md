In Year 7 I have learnt from I.T about many different topics such as media to how to use Microbit. I think my strengths have been in listening and creating projects like scratch and microbit. I think my weaknesses would be in keeping up with what is said in the class and doing it at home. The target I would set for myself would be to make more detailed notes to remember easier and do it at home.
