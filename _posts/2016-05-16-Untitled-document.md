In lesson we were introduced to microbit, a website that teaches you basic coding, and had a tutorial on how to make our own sorting hat like the one from Harry Potter. We used the basic structure to make it a random name generator or a Dr Challoners house generator and other things like it. We also used our names in the random generator and decided upon other things to do. If I were to do it again I would spend more time trying to tinker with my finished code.
