Week 1

In this lesson we learnt the basics of google spreadsheets. We learnt how to add, subtract, multiply and divide using the basic codes. We created a sheet called Practise and got taught from Mr Keen. The thing I will change for next time is paying more attention to Mr Keen and tried to made more of an effort to develop my code.
