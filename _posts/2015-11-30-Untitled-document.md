In class we used style.scss to make our page look nice. To make it look nice we used a website called HTML colour picker and picked a colour from all of the choices. Once we had picked that colour we copied it and pasted it into the style.scss file under Body-Background. We committed changes and then checked in settings just in case any of the code had broken. If it hadn't broken then our page would have a nice background with the colour you chose. We learnt how to do this in class.
