In class today we discussed what we felt scared about on the internet. We got into groups of four and talked about the things we felt most intimidated about the the big world that is the internet. We then fed back to the teacher what we thought. People said things like stalkers or catfishes but didn't know the depth to what the words meant. If I were to explain what I felt most scared about again I would know the true meaning of the word and talk in depth of what it means.
