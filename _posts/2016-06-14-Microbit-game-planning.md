In today's lesson we had a supply teacher so we planned our microbit games that we will be starting to make next lesson. The questions that we had to answer were there to help us make our game and is as follows: 1) Name of Game

                                                       2) Purpose of game

                                                       3) Number of players

                                                       4) What inputs will the game have?

                                                       5) What processes will the program calculate?

                                                       6) What outputs will the game have?
