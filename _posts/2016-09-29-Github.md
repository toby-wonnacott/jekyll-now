    <td>I learnt by listening and completing the task set. We were talked to by our teacher about how to make our Github's look nicer and cooler. After Mr. Keen showed us how we were meant to add things to our Github. The strategies that were effective included listening carefully to what was said and remembering what to do when we sat back in our places.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were being able to remember the stuff that was said just before such as the things that we could of changed in our css. The habits I need to work on are listening more carefully to what was said and mentally processing it in my mind.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The things I will change for next lesson are being more alert about what Mr. Keen talks about and remembering all of it. This will hopefully improve my learning and the work that I create by making work that includes more of what is set in class.</td>
