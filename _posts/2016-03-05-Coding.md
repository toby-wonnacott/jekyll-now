In class we used a website called codecombat to learn basic coding on the computer. We had to make our way through the levels and tell the character what to do. We got to upgrade our character as we made more levels and got more coins to buy armour and weapons. We used simple codes to make our character move up, down, left, right and attack to complete the level. As we made more levels we had to write more advanced coding.
