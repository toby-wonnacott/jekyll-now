1. How was it to create your identity map? I found it quite fun and loved trying to put as much into it as I could

2. How did you feel about sharing your map with the rest of class in this way? I did not mind sharing it with the class because I think that my work followed the criteria.

3. How did it feel to comment on the identity maps? I liked looking at other people's identity maps because i liked seeing what everyone did

4. Did you enjoy this process or would you have rather asked questions and commented directly to the student as we sometimes do during class presentations? I liked individually going round and commenting on everyone's work

5. How did it feel to get the comments back and read through them? Were there any surprises? I had good comments on my work and it gave me a confident boost

6. How is this process different from commenting on something online when you can't see the person?  Because you donâ€™t know if they are lying about themselves on the internet

7. Did your identity map help to create a sense of what you would like to post more of or less of in the future? Yes, I think it helped me  think about posting more truthful things on social media

8. Are there any other changes you want to make in the media you use based on this activity? I do not have any social media.

9. Did these six lessons change how you view social media? If so, how? They helped me have a wider knowledge of social media and how it could affect us in the future

10. Did the lessons change how you plan on using social media in the future? If so, how? The lessons made me plan using social media more positively and posting stuff that is more true to who I am.
