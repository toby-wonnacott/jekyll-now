In class we talked about the advantages and disadvantages of social media.We took it in turns to write something bad or good about social media on the board under the titles advantages and disadvantages. Under the title advantages there were comments like you can keep in contact with your friends and family or you can keep up to date with the news. Under the title disadvantages there were comments like there can be upsetting or nasty comments pointed towards you or being hacked by someone and them putting stuff up that you don't want to put up. We discussed about a comment on the disadvantages side of the board saying "you can be stalked and people can find where you live" and said that people can only stalk you if you are willing to put up the information.
