We talked about the different types of media like commercial, radio, magazine, newspaper. We watched a commercial in class on the board about hamsters exercising and going to a premier in a new kia. We tried to pick out the text (what you can see in the advert) and subtext (the hidden message) in the commercial and learnt how we do. We discussed the untold story within the advert and decided that it was if you are slim you will become famous and also if you drive the kia. We agreed on the the target market being people looking for a car to buy including elder and middle-aged people.
