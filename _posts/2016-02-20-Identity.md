In class we discussed how we show our identity on social media and how different it is compared to our actual life. We looked at how other people see us when they look at our social media and talked about how we want people to see ourselves as. For example if you picked your nose you would not put that in your social media and put something good like you have a passion for sport. 

For our homework we were set a task to create an identity map over the half term and were told how we should make it. We looked at some examples on the board and saw how it should look. We got a bit of time to make a start to our identity map after we discussed about what to and what not do.
